# Stock Market Prediction

This project involves predicting stock prices and generating personalized recommendations (Buy, Sell, Hold) for High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The system employs SARIMAX for stock price prediction and KNN Classifier for recommendation.

### Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
Models: SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

### Results
SARIMAX Performance:

MAE: 5.85
MSE: 44.80
RMSE: 6.69
SMAPE: 0.034

KNN Classifier Performance:

Validation Accuracy: 0.85
